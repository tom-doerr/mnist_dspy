      "instructions": "You are tasked with classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset based on a 28x28 pixel matrix provided as input. The pixel matrix consists of grayscale values ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 represents a black pixel and higher values represent lighter shades. Your goal is to analyze the pixel matrix, identify the pattern of the digit, and predict the corresponding digit (0-9). \n\nTo achieve this, follow these steps:\n1. **Examine the pixel matrix**: Look for regions with high-intensity pixels (values close to 255) that form the shape of the digit. Note the distribution of these pixels, including any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines, loops, or curves.\n2. **Compare with known patterns**: Use your knowledge of MNIST digit patterns to compare the observed pixel distribution with typical representations of digits 0-9. For example, a single vertical line of high-intensity pixels is characteristic of the digit \"1,\" while a loop at the top and a vertical line extending downward suggests the digit \"9.\"\n3. **Refine your reasoning**: If the initial analysis is inconclusive, consider additional features such as the presence of multiple loops, the angle of strokes, or the overall symmetry of the digit. Iteratively refine your reasoning to improve the accuracy of your prediction.\n4. **Output the predicted digit**: Based on your analysis, output the most likely digit (0-9) along with a clear explanation of your reasoning. Ensure your reasoning aligns with the observed pixel patterns and supports your final classification.\n\nRemember to provide a detailed and logical explanation for your prediction, as this will help validate the accuracy of your classification.",
